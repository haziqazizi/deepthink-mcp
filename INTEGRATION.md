# DeepThink MCP Server - Claude Code Integration Guide

ðŸ§  **Advanced AI reasoning with O3-Pro, designed for easy setup and clear error handling.**

This guide shows you how to integrate the DeepThink MCP server with Claude Code to access OpenAI O3-Pro for complex problem solving and deep analysis.

## Prerequisites

1. **Claude Code** installed and working
2. **Node.js** (v18+ recommended) 
3. **OpenAI API key** (required - others optional)
4. **AI DeepThink server** built and tested

## ðŸš€ Quick Integration Steps

### 1. Add to Claude Code with API Key

Add the DeepThink server to Claude Code with your API key:

```bash
claude mcp add deepthink-mcp --scope user --env OPENAI_API_KEY=your-api-key-here -- node /Users/haziqazizi/code/deepthink-mcp/src/server.js
```

### 2. Start Claude Code

```bash
claude
```

### 3. Verify Connection

Inside Claude Code, check that the MCP server is connected:

```
/mcp
```

You should see `deepthink-mcp` listed as a connected server.

### 4. Test the Tools

Try using the DeepThink tools:

```
Use deepthink to solve: What is 15 * 23?
```

Claude will prompt you to approve using the tool - click "Yes" to proceed.

## Available Tool

Once integrated, you'll have access to this tool in Claude Code:

### ðŸ§  **deepthink** 
Advanced AI reasoning using OpenAI O3-Pro for complex problem solving and analysis
- **Query**: Your question, problem, or task for deep analysis (required)
- **Context** (optional): Additional context or background information
- **Reasoning Level**: low/medium/high (default: high - recommended for complex problems)
- **Max Tokens**: Maximum tokens for response (default: 4000)

## Integration Scopes

### Local Scope (Recommended)
```bash
claude mcp add deepthink-mcp --scope local -- node /Users/haziqazizi/code/deepthink-mcp/src/server.js
```
- Private to you only
- Stored in user settings
- Best for personal development

### Project Scope (Team Sharing)
```bash
claude mcp add deepthink-mcp --scope project -- node /Users/haziqazizi/code/deepthink-mcp/src/server.js
```
- Creates `.mcp.json` in project root
- Can be shared with team via git
- Requires approval for security

### User Scope (Global)
```bash
claude mcp add deepthink-mcp --scope user -- node /Users/haziqazizi/code/deepthink-mcp/src/server.js
```
- Available across all projects
- Private to your user account

## Configuration File Method

Alternatively, you can manually create a `.mcp.json` file in your project:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "deepthink-mcp": {
      "command": "node",
      "args": ["src/server.js"],
      "cwd": "/Users/haziqazizi/code/deepthink-mcp",
      "env": {
        "OPENAI_API_KEY": "${OPENAI_API_KEY}",
        "GOOGLE_API_KEY": "${GOOGLE_API_KEY}",
        "ANTHROPIC_API_KEY": "${ANTHROPIC_API_KEY}",
        "NODE_ENV": "production",
        "LOG_LEVEL": "info",
        "CONFIG_PATH": "config/models.yaml"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

This method uses environment variable expansion, so make sure your API keys are set in your shell environment.

## Managing the Integration

### List all MCP servers
```bash
claude mcp list
```

### Get server details
```bash
claude mcp get deepthink-mcp
```

### Remove the server
```bash
claude mcp remove deepthink-mcp
```

### Check status in Claude Code
```
/mcp
```

## Usage Examples

### Example 1: Automatic Model Selection
```
Use deepthink to analyze this complex data pattern and provide insights: [your data]
```
â†’ DeepThink will automatically choose the best model (likely O3 for analysis)

### Example 2: Specific Model Request  
```
Use deepthink with model o3-mini to quickly calculate compound interest for $1000 at 5% for 10 years
```

### Example 3: High Reasoning Tasks
```
Use deepthink with high reasoning level to solve this multi-step logic puzzle: [puzzle]
```

### Example 4: Complex Analysis
```
Use deepthink to analyze the architectural patterns in this codebase and suggest improvements: [code context]
```

### Example 5: Problem Solving
```
Use deepthink to break down this complex algorithm optimization problem step by step: [problem description]
```

## ðŸ”§ Troubleshooting

DeepThink provides clear, helpful error messages. Here are common issues and solutions:

### ðŸ”‘ API Key Issues

**"OpenAI API key not found"**
- **Fix**: Re-add the server with your API key:
  ```bash
  claude mcp remove deepthink-mcp
  claude mcp add deepthink-mcp --scope user --env OPENAI_API_KEY=your-key-here -- node /Users/haziqazizi/code/deepthink-mcp/src/server.js
  ```
- **Verify**: Your key starts with `sk-`

**"Invalid OpenAI API key"**
- Get a new key: https://platform.openai.com/api-keys
- Update your MCP configuration with the new key
- Restart Claude Code

### ðŸ’³ Quota & Billing Issues

**"API quota exceeded"**
- Check usage: https://platform.openai.com/usage
- Add billing information if needed
- O3 models require credits

**"Rate limit exceeded"**  
- Wait 1-2 minutes before trying again
- Use lower reasoning levels: `reasoning_level: "medium"` or `"low"`
- O3 models have strict rate limits

### ðŸ¤– Model Access Issues

**"O3-Pro model not available"**
- O3 models are in limited preview
- Check if your account has access
- Contact OpenAI support for access

### ðŸ”§ Connection Issues

**"Connection closed" errors**
- **Windows users**: Use `cmd /c` wrapper:
  ```bash
  claude mcp add deepthink-mcp -- cmd /c node /Users/haziqazizi/code/deepthink-mcp/src/server.js
  ```
- **All users**: Verify the file path is correct

**"Server not responding"**
- Run diagnostics: `node test-isolated.js` (may fail due to missing env vars)
- Check the error messages in Claude Code
- Verify your API key is correctly set in the MCP configuration

**"Tool not found" errors**
- Verify connection: `/mcp` in Claude Code
- Remove and re-add the server:
  ```bash
  claude mcp remove deepthink-mcp
  claude mcp add deepthink-mcp --scope local -- node /Users/haziqazizi/code/deepthink-mcp/src/server.js
  ```

### ðŸ†˜ Need More Help?

1. **Check server status**: `claude mcp list`
2. **View logs**: Look for clear error messages in Claude Code  
3. **Re-add server**: Remove and add with correct API key

## Security Notes

- **API Keys**: Keep your API keys secure and never commit them to version control
- **Local Scope**: Use local scope for personal development to keep your configuration private
- **Project Scope**: Only use project scope when you trust your team members with the configuration
- **Rate Limits**: The server includes built-in rate limiting to prevent API abuse

## Performance Tips

- **Model Selection**: Let DeepThink choose the model automatically for best cost/performance balance
- **Reasoning Levels**: Use "low" or "medium" for O3 models unless you need maximum reasoning capability
- **Caching**: The server caches model health checks to improve performance

---

ðŸŽ‰ **You're all set!** Your DeepThink MCP server is now integrated with Claude Code, giving you access to multiple AI models with intelligent routing and cost optimization.
